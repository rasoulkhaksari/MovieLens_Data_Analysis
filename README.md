# **MovieLens Data Analysis**

GroupLens Research provides a number of collections of movie ratings data collected from users of MovieLens in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The data provide movie ratings, movie metadata (genres and year), and demographic data about the users (age, zip code, gender identification, and occupation). Such data is often of interest in the development of recommendation systems based on machine learning algorithms. While we do not explore machine learning techniques in detail in this book, I will show you how to slice and dice datasets like these into the exact form you need.

The MovieLens 1M dataset contains 1 million ratings collected from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies. Itâ€™s spread across three tables: ratings, user information, and movie information.
